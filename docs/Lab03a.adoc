[[exercise-01-installing-openshift-cli]]
Exercise 01: Installing OpenShift CLI
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

[[command-line-interface]]
COMMAND LINE INTERFACE
++++++++++++++++++++++

OpenShift ships with a feature rich web console as well as command line
tools to provide users with a nice interface to work with applications
deployed to the platform. The OpenShift tools are a single executable
written in the Go programming language and is available for the
following operating systems:

* Microsoft Windows
* Apple OS X
* Linux

[[installing-the-cli]]
Installing the CLI
++++++++++++++++++

The easiest way to *download* the *CLI* is by accessing the *Command
line tools* page on the web console.

1.  Click on down arrow key as shown in below screenshot and click on *Command Line Tools*.
+
image:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SpektraSystems/openshift-container-platform/master/images/81cl_tools.jpg[]

2.  On *Command Line Tools* page, click on *Latest Release*.
+
image:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SpektraSystems/openshift-container-platform/master/images/82cl_latestrelease.jpg[]

3.  Now, you need to *login* in to your *red hat account*(one which has license for OpenShift)
+
image:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SpektraSystems/openshift-container-platform/master/images/83redhatlogin.jpg[]

4.  Scroll down and click on *download*.
5.  Once the file has been downloaded, you will need to *extract* the *contents* of the same at below directories.
+
Windows: **C:\OpenShift**
+
OS X: **~/OpenShift** 
+
Linux: **~/OpenShift**
+
*Windows* : To extract a zip archive on windows, you will need a zip utility installed on your system. With newer versions of windows (greater than XP), this is provided by the operating system. Just right click on the downloaded file using file explorer and select to extract the contents to
+
*OS X* : Open a terminal window and change to the directory where you downloaded the file. Once you are in the directory, enter in the following command:

    $ tar zxvf <File_Name>
+
*Linux* : Open a terminal window and change to the directory where you downloaded the file. Once you are in the directory, enter in the following command:

    $ tar zxvf <File_Name>

6.  Now you will need to add *oc* to your system’s environment variable path:
+*Windows* : Open Command prompt and run below command:

    set PATH=%PATH%;C:\OpenShift
+
*OS X*: Open shell and run below command.

    $ export PATH=$PATH:~/OpenShift
+
*Linux* : Open shell and run below command.

    $ export PATH=$PATH:~/OpenShift

7.  Now run below command on shell/command prompt to check the *version* of OpenShift client an to verify that it is successfully configured.

[[exercise-02-deployment-in-openshift-using-cli]]
Exercise 02: Deployment in OpenShift using CLI
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In this exercise, you will learn how to create a new project on OpenShift and how to create an application from an existing docker image.

1. Launch the command line and run below command and enter *username* and *password* as you have received in your lab mail.

....
oc login <URL of OpenShift:8443>
....

1.  Create an *OpenShift project* by running below command.
2.  Now you can see the *project* is created successfully.

....
oc get projects
....

1.  You can also check the *status* of the *project* by running the
following command.

....
oc status
....

1.  Create new *application* using below command

....
oc new-app redhatworkshops/welcome-php --name=welcome
....

1.  The above command uses the *docker image* to deploy a docker
container in a pod. you will notice that a deployed pod runs and it
starts an application pod as shown below.

....
oc get pods
....

1.  To view the list of *services* in the project, run the following
command

....
oc get services
....

1.  Now add a route to the service with the following command.

....
oc expose service welcome --name=welcomehost 
....

1.  Now go to your *OpenShift platform* and click on
applications>hostname, you can access the *application* from the browser
and see the result.

1.  To view all the *components* that were created in your *project*,
run the command given below.

....
oc get all
....

1.  Now you can *delete* all these *components* by running one command.

....
oc get all --all
....

[[exercise-03-create-an-app-using-docker-build]]
Exercise 03: Create an App using Docker build
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In this exercise, you will learn how to create an *application* from a
Dockerfile. OpenShift takes Dockerfile as an input and generates your
application docker image for you.

1.  You can create a new *project* or use *existing project* that
created in exercise 3. To make sure you have the existing project run
the following command.

1.  Now, we are using the Dockerfile as the basis to create a *docker
image* for application. Run the command is given below.

....
oc new-app https://github.com/RedHatWorkshops/time --context-dir=rhel
....

1.  Now, look at the *buildconfig* by running the command shown below.

....
oc get bc time -o json
....

1.  To view the list of *build*, run command given below.

....
oc get builds
....

1.  Run the command as shown below to look at the *build logs*.

....
oc  logs build/time-1 
....

1.  Now, we will do *deployment configuration* by running the following
command.

....
oc get dc -o json
{
    "apiVersion": "v1",
    "items": [
        {
            "apiVersion": "v1",
            "kind": "DeploymentConfig",
            "metadata": {
                "annotations": {
                    "openshift.io/generated-by": "OpenShiftNewApp"
                },
…………
…………
…………
                "creationTimestamp": "2017-11-10T11:22:28Z",
                "generation": 3,
                "labels": {
    "metadata": {},
    "resourceVersion": "",
    "selfLink": ""
}
....

1.  Now, you can get the *list of pods*, Run the following command given
below.

....
oc get pods
....

1.  Now, add a *route* to expose that service, Run the following command
given below.

....
oc get services
....

1.  Now, we *expose* the service as a route.

....
oc expose service time
....

1.  Now, we check whether the *route* is exposed.

....
oc get routes
....

1.  To run the *application*, copy the host/port and paste in browser
and you can see the result.
