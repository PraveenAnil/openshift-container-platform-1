6.  Now *execute* the following command in the *cloud shell* to create a *key vault* in the existing resource group.
     `az keyvault create -n <uniquename> -g <ResourceGroup> -l <LocationOfResourceGroup> --enabled-for-template-deployment true`
    ``` Note: Provide the existing Resource Group name, it’s location and a unique name for key vault in the above command when executing```

9.  Now **execute** the following command to **store** the generated key in the key vault.
       ```
       az keyvault secret set --vault-name <keyvaultname> -n osdemovaultsecret --file ~/.ssh/id_rsa
       ```
       ```
       Note: Substitute for key vault name in the above command with the name of the keyvault created earlier when executing.
       ```<img src="../images/32store_key.jpg"/>
